    <h2 class="display">the "display" property</h2>

    <div class="slayd3-part2">
        <div class="slayd3-text1">
            <p>display is CSS's most important property for controlling layout. Every element has a default display
                value
                depending on what type of element it is. The default for most elements is usually block or inline. A
                block
                element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always just called an inline
                element.
            </p>
            <h2 class="block">block</h2>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="about-div">
        <div class="box1">a</div>
        <p>div is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to
            the
            left and right as far as it can. Other common block-level elements are p and form, and new in HTML5 are
            header, footer, section, and more.</p>
        <div class="box2">b</div>
    </div>

    <div class="slayd3-part3">
        <div class="slayd3-text2">
            <h2 class="heads">inline</h2>
            <p> span is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph span like
                this span without disrupting the flow of that paragraph. The a element is the most common
                inline
                element, since you use them for links.</p>
            <h2 class="heads">none</h2>
            <p>Another common display value is none. Some specialized elements such as script use this as their default.
                It is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without really deleting and recreating
                them.
                <br><br>
                This is different from visibility. Setting display to none will render the page as though the element
                does not exist. visibility: hidden; will hide the element, but the element will still take up the space
                it would if it was fully visible.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heads">other display values</h2>
            <p>There are plenty of more exotic display values, such as list-item and table. <span>Here is an exhaustive
                    list.</span>
                We'll discuss inline-block and flex later on.</p>
            <h2 class="heads">extra credit</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned, every element has a default display type. However, you can always override this! Though
                it wouldn't make sense to make an inline div, you can use this to customize the display of elements that
                have particular semantics. A common example is making inline li elements for horizontal menus.</p>

                <button class="btn"><a href="./index2.html">Previous</a></button>
                <button class="btn"><a href="../index.html">Next</a></button>
            </div>
